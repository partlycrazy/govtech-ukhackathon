### **FAQ**
<b style="color:#695db1">Who is organising this event?</b>
- CodeFiesta is organised by students for students, in collaboration with [GovTech Singapore](https://tech.gov.sg). GovTech Singapore is supporting CodeFiesta with speakers, judges and challenge statements as well as sponsoring the prizes. GovTech Singapore is [WAITING ONE-LINER]. [Click here](/content/contact-us) to find out more about the committee.

<b style="color:#695db1">How will CodeFiesta be affected given the current COVID-19 situation?</b>
- The event will be held virtually. Registration is open for all interested individuals and will close **20 June 2021**. Do sign up now before our slots are full!

<b style="color:#695db1">Where can I find event updates with regards to COVID-19?</b>
- This website will be updated regularly. Registered teams will receive additional email notifications should there be any event updates.

<b style="color:#695db1">Can I participate with an existing idea or project?</b>
- All submissions will be based on the content that is created by the team. For example, a proposed solution could incorporate existing solutions in the market, but the project will be evaluated based on the actual content created (less whatever is already in the market).

<b style="color:#695db1">What do I need for the competition?</b>
- Minimally, each participant will need a working laptop with an Internet connection. 

<b style="color:#695db1">What skills do I need for the competition?</b>
- You need to have a strong interest in harnessing tech for public good. We are looking for creative problem-solving skills. Technical skills are a bonus but not necessary – if you enjoy the challenge of applying your mind to solve a real-world problem, then CodeFiesta is for you!

### **Eligibility**
<b style="color:#695db1">I am not currently in Singapore. Can I attend?</b>
- Yes! The event will be held virtually and is mainly organised for overseas Singaporean students. As the organisers and speakers are in Singapore, the event will be held in Singapore time so it is open to participants from Singapore too.

<b style="color:#695db1">How big should the teams be?</b>
- 3-4 people per team. We highly encourage you to sign up as a team so that you can work with people you are comfortable with. Each team should be made up of a majority of Singaporeans / PR, with a maximum of one (1) non-Singaporean/PR per team.

<b style="color:#695db1">Can non-Singaporeans or Permanent Residents attend the Hackathon?</b>
- Yes! However, each team should be made up of a majority of Singaporeans / PRs, with a maximum of one (1) non-Singaporean/PR per team. If you are unable to find a complete team on your own, we can link you up with other participants. Please indicate this when you sign up on the registration form.
