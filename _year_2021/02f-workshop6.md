In times of virtual events, this is the equivalent of enjoying a warm cup of coffee with our promising young engineers - many of whom graduated not long ago from uni. Join us in a private subreddit for an "ask me anything" session and hear about their experiences with GovTech and what working is actually like! This is where you can get the lowdown on application tips, internship suggestions, and career progression! You will receive a link closer to the event date.
