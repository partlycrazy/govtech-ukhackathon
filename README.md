## Why Markdown and YAML?

Traditionally, in order to edit a website, one had to write in pure HTML. This is challenging for website administrators who had limited experience with HTML as it is not immediately readable or intuitive to non-experienced users. 

Our team decided to go with Markdown (.md) – more human readable syntax – so as to empower non-technical website administrators.

While Markdown is appropriate for writing long segments of text, it alone does not allow users to edit small details of the website (e.g. change the hero-banner image) without diving into the HTML.

We therefore chose to supplement the Markdown syntax with YAML (.yml) – yet another human readable syntax.


## Development Comments
- Thought it might be easier to maintain if we had an "archive" folder with previous years' content, and for the current nav-bar to be kept for the current year. When a HOTO is done to next year's orgcomm, the layout could then be arranged. This is easier to manage and scale if we plan to run the competition for many years in the future (hopefully!)
