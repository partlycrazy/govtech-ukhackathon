Due to popular demand, we are hosting an introductory lecture into data science and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the real-world practical applications. Hear about case studies, and ask any burning questions you have about building a career in data science.

The session will be interactive, and participants may submit questions beforehand (we will send a link for you to do so).
