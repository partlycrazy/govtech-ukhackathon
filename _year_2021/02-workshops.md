### **Workshops**
We have a series of workshops and a Reddit session organised as part of CodeFiesta 2021 which offer opportunities to learn about specific domain areas and find out more about GovTech (psst, there might be some tips which will help you to ace your prototype submission)!

#### Workshop 1 : Ideation - Sink or Swim?
*Friday 25 June 2021, 1915hrs*<br>
*Speakers: [Feng-Yuan Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feng-yuan-liu-9b09aa42/) (Basis AI), [Joshua Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwonged/) (Hypotenuse AI)*<br>
All startups begin with an idea - for some, the idea pops out of nowhere, and yet others spend substantial periods of time testing out the idea before finalising it.
<br>In this workshop, hear from two startup founders who have launched their businesses and how the ideation process began for them. What kind of market research is necessary? Does the idea come first or the solution or is it a happy coincidence?


#### Workshop 2 : Deep dive into GovTech’s product creation process - Design Thinking 
*Friday 25 June 2021, 2000hrs*<br>
*Speakers: [Dominic Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-chan-b0037526/) (Director, GovTech Singapore), [Simon Ang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonang/) (Deputy Director, GovTech Singapore)*<br>
Before launching a solution to your customers, you first need to understand what they need. How did GovTech design the LifeSG app before launch? Design thinking may be a buzzword but fundamentally it is a problem-solving skill that can be applied to all sorts of problems.<br>
This session covers user empathy, ideation, solution, testing and the iterative process that occurs before launching a product. Learn about the differences when targeting different user profiles, ranging from individuals to corporates and government agencies.

#### Workshop 3 : Introduction to Data Science and AI  
*Monday 28 June 2021, 2000hrs*<br>
*Speakers: [Alvina Goh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvina-goh/) (Deputy Director, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, GovTech Singapore)*<br>
Due to popular demand, we are hosting an introductory lecture into data science and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the real-world practical applications. Hear about case studies, and ask any burning questions you have about building a career in data science.<br>
The session will be interactive, and participants may submit questions beforehand (we will send a link for you to do so).

#### Workshop 4 : Cybersecurity - a practical introduction
*Tuesday 29 June 2021, 2000hrs*<br>
*Speakers: [Jing Loon Goh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gohjingloon/) (Associate Cybersecurity Specialist, GovTech Singapore), [Chia Hui Mah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahchiahui/) (Associate Cybersecurity Specialist, GovTech Singapore)*<br>
What does a GovTech cybersecurity engineer do on a daily basis? Join us for this introductory session where you get to ask questions and see a live demo of what goes on behind the scenes. This is your chance to meet the engineers who are building their careers in cybersecurity.<br>
The session will be interactive, and participants may submit questions beforehand (we will send a link for you to do so).


#### Workshop 5 : Prototype and Mentor Feedback
*Wednesday 30 June 2021, 2000hrs*

During this session, hear from some of the mentors who will share highlights and learnings from the first round of prototype submissions. Get inspired by ideas submitted by other teams and learn from each other.<br>
This is also where we release the shortlist of finalists who will be presenting on the final day! 

#### Reddit "Ask me Anything" session
*Thursday 1 July 2021, 2000hrs*<br>
*Panelists: [Dalson Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalson-tan/), [Eliot Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliot-lim/), and [Glenice Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenicetan/) (Tech Associates, GovTech Singapore)*<br>
In times of virtual events, this is the equivalent of enjoying a warm cup of coffee with our promising young engineers - many of whom graduated not long ago from uni. Join us in a private subreddit for an ‘ask me anything’ session and hear about their experiences with GovTech and what working is actually like! This is where you can get the lowdown on application tips, internship suggestions, and career progression!
