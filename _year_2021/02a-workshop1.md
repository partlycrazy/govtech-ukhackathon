#### Workshop 1 : Ideation - Sink or Swim?
*Friday 25 June 2021, 1915hrs*<br>
*Speakers: [Feng-Yuan Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/feng-yuan-liu-9b09aa42/) (Basis AI), [Joshua Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwonged/) (Hypotenuse AI)*<br>
All startups begin with an idea - for some, the idea pops out of nowhere, and yet others spend substantial periods of time testing out the idea before finalising it.
<br>In this workshop, hear from two startup founders who have launched their businesses and how the ideation process began for them. What kind of market research is necessary? Does the idea come first or the solution or is it a happy coincidence?
