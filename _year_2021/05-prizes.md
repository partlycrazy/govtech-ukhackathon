We have a pub quiz segment on the last day, and the top 3 winners of the pub quiz will receive “swag packs”.

All participants in the challenge will receive a certificate for taking part in the event.

There is a shortlisting stage after the weekend hackathon, where we select the shortlisted teams to make final presentations. We will share the assessment rubric for evaluating submissions closer to the event date.

On 4 July 2021, the shortlisted finalists will provide a short presentation (about 8 mins, with 2 mins of Q&A). We will share the assessment rubric for evaluating presentations closer to the event date.
