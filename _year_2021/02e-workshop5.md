#### Workshop 5 : Prototype and Mentor Feedback
*Wednesday 30 June 2021, 2000-2100hrs*<br>
During this session, hear from some of the mentors who will share highlights and learnings from the first round of prototype submissions. Get inspired by ideas submitted by other teams and learn from each other.

This is also where we release the shortlist of finalists who will be presenting on the final day!
