### **Workshops**
<!-- TODO Vet please -->
Code Fiesta 2021 offers opportunities for you to learn from both workshops and other events, giving you a glimpse of work at Govtech, and also how to ace your prototype submission!

#### Workshop 1 : Ideation - Sink or Swim?
*Speakers: Joshua Wong (Hypotenuse AI), Feng-Yuan Liu (Basis AI)*
All startups begin with an idea - for some, the idea pops out of nowhere, and yet others spend substantial periods of time testing out the idea before finalising it. 
In this workshop, hear from startup founders who have launched their businesses and how the ideation process began for them. What kind of market research is necessary? Does the idea come first or the solution or is it a happy coincidence?

#### Workshop 2 : Deep dive into GovTech’s product creation process - Design Thinking 
*Speakers: Dominic Chan* 
<!-- TODO confirm speaker -->
Before launching a solution to your customers, you first need to understand what they need. 
How did GovTech design the LifeSG app before launch? Design thinking is a buzzword but fundamentally it is a problem-solving skill that can be applied to all sorts of problems. 
This session covers user empathy, ideation, solution, testing and the iterative process that occurs before launching a product.
The speakers will also speak about differences when targeting different user profiles, ranging from individuals to corporates and government agencies.

#### Reddit AMA
*Panelists: Dalson Tan, Eliot Lim, Glenice Tan and Fionna Tong (Govtech)*
In times of virtual events, this is the equivalent of enjoying a warm cup of coffee with our promising young engineers - many of whom graduated not long ago from uni. Join us in a private subreddit for an ‘ask me anything’ session and hear about their experiences with GovTech and what working is actually like! This is where you can get the lowdown on application tips, internship suggestions, and career progression!

Participants may post their questions beforehand, panelists will post answers in the timeframe below.
