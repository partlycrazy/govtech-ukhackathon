Before launching a solution to your customers, you first need to understand what they need. How did GovTech design the LifeSG app before launch? Design thinking may be a buzzword but fundamentally it is a problem-solving skill that can be applied to all sorts of problems.<br>
This session covers user empathy, ideation, solution, testing and the iterative process that occurs before launching a product. Learn about the differences when targeting different user profiles, ranging from individuals to corporates and government agencies.
