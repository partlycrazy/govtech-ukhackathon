  - Notability app is my go-to app for note writing. It is extremely versatile and has many functions! It combines handwriting, photos and typing and brings notes to life.

  - Technology is extremely fresh and exciting. Technology has made our lives much easier and has also led to modernization in many fields. It has certainly resulted in a global revolution and advancements.

##### Lim Tian Yi
*Imperial College London, Year 2, Electronic and Information Engineering*

- What is your favourite app?
  - It would be YouTube, as it is a source of entertainment and education. I also think it is great that it is a platform for people to put out interesting content on niche interests that might not appear otherwise.
- What do you love about tech?
  - Tech is the way we turn imagination and dreams into reality. As an avid sci-fi fan, it is fascinating to see one man’s fantasy turning into reality through advances in tech.
- What is your favourite food?
  - It may be sinful but I love hokkien mee!

##### Tan Chern Heng
*Imperial College London, Year 2, Electronic and Information Engineering*

- What is your favourite app?
  - Definitely YouTube, both for entertainment and for learning. There are so many helpful videos and learning guides on Youtube that it is difficult to stop watching interesting videos one after another
- What do you love about tech?
  - Technology gives us the power to turn our imagination into reality. The things that we take for granted now were dreamt up by people in the past. And maybe things we dream up now will be what our future generations take for granted.
- What is your favourite food?
  - Hmm, there are so many good foods in Singapore, but I think my favourite is Laksa. Too bad it is very difficult to make it yourself when you are so far away from home.

##### Wee Xian Bin
*University of Cambridge, MPhil, Industrial Systems, Manufacture & Management*

- What is your favourite app?
  - Microsoft OneNote - I’ve gone through so many note-taking and work organisation apps, but I find this to be one of the most versatile apps that can be integrated with my laptop and with Outlook as well.
- What do you love about tech?
  - To me, technology isn’t just solely about digitalisation as the next big thing - as Danny Hillis once said, “technology is everything that doesn’t work yet”! Put in a broader sense, technology is a means of empowering governments, industries and people to transform the way we live and work, and for the betterment of the future.
- What is your favourite food?
  - I love eating all types of cuisines - but the first thing I would want to eat after returning to Singapore would be a bowl of bak chor mee (肉脞面)!

##### Zhang Yufeng
*Imperial College London, Year 1, Computing*

- What is your favourite app?
  - Have to choose Spotify here! As an avid music lover, there's something to be said about how Spotify made listening to music super convenient and user friendly.
- What do you love about tech?
  - There’s always something new! Human creativity knows no bound and in some ways, technology acts as both a catalyst for rapid innovation, as well as the product of one’s efforts. We live in a very exciting time where digital technology is still rather nascent, meaning that there’s still a lot more to discover and look forward to!
- What is your favourite food?
  - My go-to comfort food is definitely Encik Tan’s chicken cutlet curry rice. Apart from that, anything unhealthy like burgers and pizza will do.
