<h2 style="color:#695db1">What is CodeFiesta@GovTech?</h2>
CodeFiesta@GovTech 2021 is an online competition organised by a student organising committee in collaboration with GovTech Singapore. As part of our ongoing efforts to encourage students to explore careers in technology, this competition will be based on real-life problem statements and is open to all students!

The event will feature a challenge based on the tech for public good mission, as well as a series of workshops and events aimed at helping students increase their practical knowledge of tech domain areas.

At the end of the competition, attractive prizes will be awarded to the top teams.

<h2 style="color:#695db1">What is the challenge about?</h2>
The challenge will mainly be compressed into the first weekend of the event.

To solve the challenge, you will primarily need problem solving and design thinking skills. Coding skills are not necessary!

Teams should submit their prototypes by Sunday 27th June (hackathon-style) and shortlisted teams will present the following weekend (Sunday 4th July).

<h2 style="color:#695db1">Challenge statements</h2>
The challenge statements will be released at the opening session on Friday 25th June 2021. You will receive a link to the session on successful registration for CodeFiesta.

The challenge statements will be related to GovTechâ€™s mission, "Engineering Digital Government, Making Lives Better" and will be focused on `#techforpublicgood`. We are looking at real world problems, with the hope that the solutions submitted would be adopted by GovTech for further development.
